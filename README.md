# Grade Calculator

Welcome to the Grade Calculator! This application helps you calculate your current average grade and determine the grades you need to achieve your desired final average. It is especially useful for students pursuing a degree where grades are based on a points system.

## Getting Started

To run the Grade Calculator, you need Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your computer. If you don't have Java installed, you can download it from the official website: [Download Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/)

### Running the Application

1. Download the "GradeCalculator.jar" file from the repository.
2. Open a command prompt or terminal. (Maybe you can also just Double-click it and Open, but this is the fancy way)
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the "GradeCalculator.jar" file.
4. Run the following command:
java -jar GradeCalculator.jar

5. The Grade Calculator application will launch.

## How to Use

1. Enter the number of courses you have completed for each grade level (6, 7, 8, 9, and 10) in the respective text fields.
2. Enter your desired final average in the "Desired final average" field.
3. Click the "Calculate" button.
4. A pop-up window will display your current statistics, including the number of courses completed, current average, courses left to complete, and desired average.
5. If there are combinations available to achieve your desired average, another pop-up window will show the number of grades you need to achieve at each level.
6. To reset the grades, click the "Reset" button.

## Customizing the Number of Courses

By default, the Grade Calculator assumes a Bachelor's degree with 180 ECTS, which is equivalent to 36 courses. If your degree has a different number of courses, the application allows you to customize it.

1. When you run the application, you will be prompted with a pop-up asking if you are pursuing a Bachelor's degree with 180 ECTS.
2. Click "Yes" to continue with the default value of 36 courses.
3. Click "No" to enter a custom value for the total number of courses in your degree.
4. Enter the total number of courses in the input box and click "OK".
5. The Grade Calculator will update the number of courses left to complete based on your input.

## Future of this project

Advanced Grade Proposition: Provide users with more personalized grade suggestions by considering trade-offs between higher and lower grades. For example, allowing the user to prioritize a few perfect scores (10s) in exchange for fewer high grades (9s) and more moderate grades (8s and 7s). This feature would add an element of fun and customization to the calculations.

Online Progress Tracking: Transform the Grade Calculator into a web application where users can create accounts, save their progress, and easily add grades as they go. This would allow users to track their academic performance over time and receive updated targets based on their latest grades.

Better Documentation: In the future, you can expand the documentation on the code to provide more detailed explanations and insights into the underlying algorithms and calculations. This will not only help others understand the code better but also serve as a great exercise to improve your own coding skills.
